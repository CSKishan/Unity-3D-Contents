Three Teddy Bears resizing project.
### Concept used:
Vector3 newScale = transform.localScale;
newScale.x (X coordinates)
newScale.y (Y coordinates)
newScale.z (Z coordinates)

newScale.x \*=3; (expanding x measure by 3) 
transform.localScale = newScale; (saving the new size)
*Note: copy-change-copy methodology is used in C# as opposed to direct changes
